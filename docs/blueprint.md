- Primary color: Deep blue (#1E3A8A), to convey professionalism, trustworthiness, and a sense of innovation, mirroring the depth of Jeremie's technical skills.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F9FAFB), nearly white, providing a clean, modern backdrop that highlights the content without distraction.  
- Accent color: Vibrant purple (#7C3AED), selected for CTAs and interactive elements, ensuring they stand out and attract user attention. The purple complements the deep blue and adds a touch of creativity.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to convey a modern, tech-forward feel and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Use custom-designed icons that reflect Jeremie's skills and projects. The icons should be minimalistic and animated, providing a visual representation of each technology and achievement.
- Implement a modern, grid-based layout with generous whitespace to ensure the content is easily digestible and visually appealing.
- Use subtle yet impactful animations throughout the portfolio. Employ scroll-triggered animations, parallax effects, and interactive transitions to enhance user engagement and showcase Jeremie's projects in a dynamic way.
